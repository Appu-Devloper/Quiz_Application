# quiz_app

A new Flutter project.
Description:

The Flutter application is designed to display a quiz based on questions and options provided in a CSV file. The app includes a variety of features to enhance the quiz-taking experience:

Quiz Presentation: Questions and options are sourced from a CSV file, and the app efficiently presents them in a user-friendly format.
Answer Feedback: The app clearly indicates which answers are correct and which are incorrect, providing immediate feedback to the user.
Timer Implementation: A countdown timer is integrated into the quiz, adding an element of challenge and excitement to the experience.
Result Display: At the end of the quiz, the app displays the user's results, including their score and time taken.
Despite its strong functionality, there is room for further development:

Data Persistence: Integrating sqflite for local database storage can enable the app to save quiz results, allowing users to track their progress and performance over time.
Graphical Analysis: Visualizations such as graphs and charts can be introduced to display quiz results, providing users with insights into their strengths and areas for improvement.
Category-wise Quiz: The app could be expanded to include category-based quizzes, allowing users to focus on specific subjects or topics of interest.
With these improvements, the app can offer an even more comprehensive and engaging quiz experience.
